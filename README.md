#..............................................Custom Social Media Dashboard Page...............#

This is a simple FrontEnd Mentor Challenge that I took on to create the custom Social Media Dashboard that is 
accesible to all and has both light/dark themes that switch depending on the users' preferences.

Special Thanks to Jess Chan (Coder Coder), it's her design flow I followed as I designed this theme. 

Have a look at it, I know you'l love it.

Peace.
